Develop a Task Management and Motivation App using React
Make it dynamically display tasks and interject motivational texts to inspire users as they navigate their workload.
To start this application, either use 'npx create-react-app my-app' in the terminal and replace the automatically generated App.js and App.css files with the ones I provide, and add the TaskGenerator.js, FancyText.js, and tasks.js files to the src folder, or install the entire mp-app folder. Once either of those is complete, use 'npm start' in the terminal.
